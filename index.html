            <h2>Why Calling Works</h2>

            <h3>Calling your congressperson is the most effective way to influence policy.</h3>
            <p>Once your congressperson forms a public stance on an issue, it’s hard for them to walk it back. The earlier they hear your opinion, the more likely it is you’ll make an impact. Calling is by far the most effective way to ensure that your representative hears you before they take a public stance.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>No matter their politics, calling works.</h3>
            <ul class="noMatterList">
                <li>
                    <h3><strong>If you support their stance…</strong></h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>You need to let your congressperson know! When they talk to colleagues, they use call tallies and personal stories from constituents to better support their positions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3><strong>If you oppose or don’t know their stance…</strong></h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Calling is the easiest way to sway them! Your congressperson gets regular call tally reports, letting them know how strongly their constituents feel about an issue.</p>

                    <p><strong>Why can’t I send a letter or email instead?</strong></p>
                    <p>Calling is by far the most effective way 
                    to reach your congressperson. To learn more, 
                    check out our guide to why calling works.</p>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Why do I only see my House or Senate representative?</strong></p>
                    <p>Depending on the issue, voting may have 
                    already happened in one chamber or the other, 
                    or the issue may not be active in that chamber. 
                    We regularly update who needs to be called based on 
                    legislation status so you can receive the right information.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Can I save time by mentioning multiple issues in the same call?</strong></p>
                    <p>Sometimes! This largely depends on the office 
                    and how they tally calls, but you can always ask. 
                    For cases where they can't tally multiple issues, 
                    you can call right back or spread your calls out 
                    over the day.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>What if I really don't like talking on the phone?</strong></p>
                    <p>Calling on evenings and weekends with the intent of 
                    leaving a voicemail is still a great way to make your 
                    voice heard. Congressional offices are usually open during 
                    normal business hours in their local time zone.</p>

            <h2>Who To Call First</h2>

            <div id="who-to-call-paragraphs">
                <p>Start with their D.C. office. When you open an issue page, we start with your congressperson’s Washington, D.C. office. You should call that one before trying a local office.</p> 

                <p>If no one picks up, leave a voicemail. Congressional offices check voicemail every day. They will tally your message just like a call. Make sure to mention your street address in the message. That way, your congressperson will know you are a constituent.</p>  

                <p>After-hours voicemails are a great way to make your voice heard if you aren't comfortable talking to someone directly.</p>

                <p>If you can’t get through, call their local offices. Your senators will have a few local offices. Since they represent your entire state, it doesn’t matter which one you call, even if it’s far away from you.</p>  

                <p>If you can’t get through, we know it’s frustrating. Congressional offices have recently been seeing record call volume.</p>

                <p>If you can’t reach your congressperson, that usually means a lot of people cared enough to call. That's  amazing! Don’t sweat it and try again later.</p>
